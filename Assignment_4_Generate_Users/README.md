# Generate Users

This assigned us with creating 4 python scripts: Keyword_User, Image_User, Link_User, and Unique_User. In each script, we will write selenium users who have an affinity towards specific elements on a webpage. The Unique User script is the most unique, with a preference able to be set, the user can drastically increase the amount of time they spend on a website.
Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** features are completed:

- [X] Organize Github folders (2 pts)
- [X] Create a user with affinity towards keyword(s) and verify that it works (3 pts)
- [X] Create a user with affinity towards image(s) and verify that it works (3 pts)
- [X] Create a user with affinity towards links and verify that it works (3 pts)
- [X] Describe a user with unique affinities (1 pt)
- [X] Create a user with unique affinities and verify that it works (3 pts)

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

- [X] Create a unique user with an affinity OUTSIDE of keywords, images, or links (1.5 pt)
    - I added the ability for preference to be set to "iframe" so that if a user is presented with an iframe, they will spend an additional amount of time on the website, up to 200s, admiring the beauty of the iframe and all of the technological advances that were put to creating this html element.
- [ ] Uploaded files for a unique user BOTH in javascript and python (1.5 pt)

This image demonstrates the terminal output when running Keyword User with an argument of both 0 and 1. When using an argument of 0, this means that we are accessing a website with a keyword I am looking for. When using an argument of 1, this keyword is not present.

This image demonstrates the terminal output when running Image User with an argument of both 0 and 1. When using an argument of 0, this means that we are accessing a website with images. When using an argument of 1, images are not present.

This image demonstrates the terminal output when running Unique User with an argument of both 0 and 1. My user prefers keywords the mostâ€“they want to find a website tailored to their exact needs. They will stay an additional duration of time if there are images and links, however, keyword is the main attraction they feature. When using an argument of 0, this means that we are accessing a website with my user's preference. When using an argument of 1, the preference is not present.
