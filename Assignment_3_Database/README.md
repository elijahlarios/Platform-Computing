# Metric Tracker with Database

This project tasked us with duplicating our Assignment 2 project and removing the export to csv related functions in the Metric_tracker folder. We then initialize a database to store metrics gathered from our selenium code from the same file. Deliverables include a new readme[^1], images, and all code for the project.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** features are completed:

- [X] Organize Github projects for Assignment 3 (2 pts)
- [X] Complete SQL Mystery Walkthrough and take a screenshot or print to PDF the webpage (2 pts)
- [X] Complete Interactive MongoDB Tutorial and take a screenshot or print to PDF the webpage Â (2 pts)
- [X] Choose a SQL or NoSQL Database and set up a server[^2] (4 pts)
- [X] Modify your metric_tracker file so that the metrics are saved onto a database (5 pts)

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

- [X] Retrieve values from the database (1 pt).
- [ ] Create separate Tables (SQL) or Documents (NoSQL) for each metric and relate them via user (2 pt).
    - Can be implemented later, but I was unsure of what this fully meant.  
- [X] DESCRIBE ANY OTHER FEATURES HERE.
    - Currently records timestamp of entrance and exit for each user, with metrics for each timestamp.
        - Final timestamp "EXIT" features more information about the webpage, like paragprah contents.

### Notes
[^1]: This file was renamed to README.md from A3_Readme.md so that github can parse the file when viewing the Repo
[^2]: The NoSQL database I implemented was Firebase. Each document is an actual timestamp, placed inside of a timestamp collection
